					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Overall it's pretty smooth and easy, we got every variables in and let the console print them without encountering any challenges.
						<br>The only slight challenge is that the car in question is not with Harry at the moment so he'll need some time to find an image of it.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>No significant problems were presented in our work. The only problem we had is to correctly put the image at our desired place (top right), 
						<br>but this was resolved rather quickly.</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>The result of our JavaScript file containing Harry's car's information is presented below.</p>
